frame resident variables are a bit broken (easy)
*a = *b is broken at the moment (easy)
Have a standard lib with a printf like function (idk)
Multiplication, division, modulo (easy)
Command line options and better output (boring)
Better codegen of common patterns (fun)
Peephole optimizations (fun)
Optimize the CFG and reg allocation (+ SSA?) (hard)
Instrumentation (fun)
Type inference Ã  la OCaml (hard)
structs, arrays (medium)
heap allocations (medium)
implement new architectures, and rework mach/frame (medium)
JIT (hard)
