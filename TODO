Normalize the IR (for example temps always on the lhs of binops) (IMPORTANT)
Command line options and better output (boring)
Better codegen of common patterns (fun)
Peephole optimizations (fun)
Optimize the CFG and reg allocation (+ SSA?) (hard)
Instrumentation (fun)
Type inference Ã  la OCaml (hard)
implement new architectures, and rework mach/frame (medium)
JIT (hard)
Handle signed and unsigned ops (medium)
Tail recursion (hard)
Missing return statement not caught (sema BUG easy boring)
Strings should be completely reworked (BUG)
Test suite (hard, boring, important)
Fix a few function pointer inconsitencies (function type vs function pointer etc)
Check l/rvalues in the AST or the IR. Doing it during parsing is a PITA
